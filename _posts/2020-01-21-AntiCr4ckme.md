<h4>CTF: Reversing [Medium] | <a href="https://crackmes.one/crackme/600098f733c5d42c3d0166c8">LINK_TO_CHALL</a> </h4>

### Overview

This crackme is harder then the last one i did, its .text section is packed. I will try my best to reverse the encrption and patch the anti-debugging techniques it utilizes. All links to subjects i wrote about in this write-up will be at the bottom of the page in the <a href="#Resource">Resource</a> section.

`I figured that its .text section is packed by looking at the entropy with DIE (Detect It Easy)`
