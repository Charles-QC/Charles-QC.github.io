### Overview

The goal of this crackme is to find out the password and make the program print out "Brava!!!".

### Write-up

This crackme is very simple, the main function takes an argument and then `strncmp` it with the password which seam to be encoded.

And yes if we try to input the "password" it prints out that it's wrong so it's most likely encoded. If you use your logic the program is most certainly encoding the input then compairing it with the encoded password.

If i had to guess i would say Caesar cipher but for educational purposes i will try to reverse the algorythm that encodes the input.

It looks like a loop that does something to the input, it's certainly the algorythm to encode it. This loop calls a function, `sub_401160`.

Alright now let's take a look at this function when we decompile it.
