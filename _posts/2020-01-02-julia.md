### Overview

The goal of this crackme is to find out the password and make the program print out "Brava!!!".

### Write-up

This crackme is very simple, the main function takes an argument and then `strncmp` it with the password which seam to be encoded.

And yes if we try to input the "password" it prints out that it's wrong so it's most likely encoded.

If i had to guess i would say Caesar cipher but for educational purposes i will try to reverse the algorythm that encodes & decodes the password.

It looks like a loop that does something to the input, it's probably the algorythm to encode it and then compare with the encoded password. This loop calls a function `sub_401160`
