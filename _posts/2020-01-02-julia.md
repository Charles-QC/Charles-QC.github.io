### Overview

The goal of this crackme is to find out the password and make the program print out "Brava!!!".

### Write-up

This crackme is very simple, the main function takes in an argument and then `strncmp` it with a string which seam to be encoded.

And yes if we try to input the "password" it prints out that it's wrong so it's most likely encoded. If you use your logic the program is most certainly encoding the input then compairing it with the encoded password.

If i had to guess i would say Caesar cipher but i will still try to prove it, anyway even if it is Caesar cipher we would have to find the shift.

It looks like a loop that does something to the input, it's certainly the algorythm to encode it. This loop calls a function, `sub_401160`.

As you can see bellow, the function check for 'a' & 'z' values in our input which is strong evidence of Caesar cipher because this cipher only shift the letters a certain ammount of times depending on the shift you give it `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher`. All we have to look for now is this shift if it exists.

And easy to find it it is, if we take one of the graph after it's conditions we can see that a varriable to our input and it's value is 4.

![Algo5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/julie-ex3.PNG)

Okay so now i think we have enought proof to say that it's encoding the input in Caesar cipher and then compairing the result with the encoded password using a shift of 4. So let's try to decode the password on a website like <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher">this one</a>. And bingo! Here is the password.

Thanks for reading my write-up, i might come back finish it later (Because right now it's quite a mess).
