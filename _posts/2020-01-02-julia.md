### Overview

The goal of this crackme is to find out the password and make the program print out "Brava!!!".

### Write-up

This crackme is very simple, the main function takes an argument and then `strncmp` it with the password which seam to be encoded.

And yes if we try to input the "password" it prints out that it's wrong so it's most likely encoded. If you use your logic the program is most certainly encoding the input then compairing it with the encoded password.

If i had to guess i would say Caesar cipher but for educational purposes i will try to reverse the algorythm that encodes the input.

![Algo1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/julie-loop.PNG)

It looks like a loop that does something to the input, it's certainly the algorythm to encode it. This loop calls a function, `sub_401160`.

As you can see bellow, the function check for 'a' & 'z' values in our input which is strong evidence of Ceasar cipher because this cipher only shift the letters a certain ammount of times depending on the shift you give it `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher`. All we have to look for now is a shift.

And easy to find it is, if we take one of the block after it's conditions we can see that a varriable to our input. The value of this varriable is 4.

![Algo5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/julie-ex3.PNG)

Okay so now i think we have enought proof to say that it's encoding the input in Ceasar cipher and then compairing the result with the encoded password using a shift of 4. So let's try to decode the password on a website like this one `https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher`. And bingo! Here is the password.

Thanks for reading my write-up, i might come back finish it later (Because right now it's quite a mess).
